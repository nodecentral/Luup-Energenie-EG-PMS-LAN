# Luup-Energenie-EG-PMS2-LAN

# Scope

This is a Luup plugin for HTTP control of the Energenie EG PMS2 LAN IP switches

Luup (Lua-UPnP) is a software engine which incorporates Lua, a popular scripting language, and UPnP, the industry standard way to control devices. Luup is the basis of a number of home automation controllers e.g. Micasaverde Vera, Vera Home Control, OpenLuup.

# Compatibility

This plug-in has been tested with the following Energenie switches

* EG PMS2 LAN

# Features

It supports the following functions:

* Creation of child devices in Vera for each switch channel
* Set each channel on or off from Vera (discrete power)
* Poll the device regularly to determine the actual status

# Usage

Create the parent instance and give it the IP address of your Energenie device. The child devices will then be created automatically.

# Limitations

While it has been tested, it has not been tested very much and may not support other related devices or those running different firmware.
